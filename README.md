# Road Accident Severity Analysis

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to understand how various factors influence accident severity. By visualizing relationships between these factors and accident severity, insights can be gained to inform safety measures and policy decisions.

**Data Description:**
The dataset includes information about road accidents, covering aspects such as:
- **Road Surface Type:** The type of surface on which the accident occurred.
- **Weather Conditions:** The weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- **Types of Junction:** The type of junction where the accident took place.
- **Vehicle Movement:** The movement patterns of vehicles involved in the accident.
- **Cause of Accident:** The reason for the accident.
- **Accident Severity:** The severity level of the accident.

**Installation Requirements:**
Make sure to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly
```

## Usage Instructions:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the road accident dataset and check for missing values.
   - Handle missing values by dropping rows with any null entries.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualize the impact of different factors on accident severity using count plots.
   - Analyze accident severity in relation to:
     - Road surface type
     - Weather conditions
     - Types of junctions
     - Vehicle movement
     - Causes of accidents

## Results
The visualizations provide insights into how different conditions affect the severity of road accidents, helping to identify potential areas for intervention and improvement in road safety.
